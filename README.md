# theoryOfScrewMelting

## What is this?

## Melting capacities at different screw diameters for different (fixed!) melting lengths and different melting fluxes.
Melting fluxes are taken from Altınkaynak's dissertation [1]

Screw throughputs are assumed to follow this formula (with throughput in kg/h and diameter in centimetres!)
```math
\dot{m}=\frac{2}{3}\cdot D^{2.7}
```
